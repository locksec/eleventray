# Description
ElevenTray is a privacy-respecting and lightweight utility for Windows 11 that ensures all system tray icons are always visible. Frustratingly, Microsoft decided to hide system tray icons by default in Windows 11, and removed the option for *"Always show all icons in the notification area."* Previous workarounds, such as using `explorer shell:::{05d7b0f4-2121-4eff-bf6b-ed3f69b894d9}` to access this setting, no longer work.

Simply install ElevenTray, and it will silently run in the background, ensuring ALL system tray icons stay visible.

# Features
* No trackers or telemetry.
* Monitors the registry for hidden system tray icons and automatically reveals them.
* Runs as a background process (`ElevenTray.exe`).
* Logs actions and events to `C:\Program Files\ElevenTray\ElevenTray.log` (default installation location).

# System Requirements
* **Operating System:** Windows 11
* **Build:** 10.0.22000 or higher

# Installation
* Download the latest version of the installer from the Releases section.
* Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
* Once installed, ElevenTray will automatically start and ensure that all tray icons remain visible. You'll see `ElevenTray.exe` running in Task Manager.

# Security & Privacy
This is open-source software, so feel free to check out the code. There are no trackers, telemetry, outbound connections, or other privacy-invasive tactics. If you prefer, you can compile the software yourself using the installer, which employs [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php). The Inno Setup script (`setup.iss`) is included for your convenience.
